# HyperparameterPipeline_Tutorial
TL;DR Tutorial notebook for hyperparameter tuning for a model set using Pipeline

This notebook was created for a workshop as part of the Insight Data Science Fellowship (Fall 2020) that I led with another fellow. It presents a basic walk through of the creation of a model fitting pipeline that uses a randomized search to tune hyperparameters.
